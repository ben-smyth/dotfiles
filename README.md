# Dependency and Dotfile Management
Scripts and configs.

## NIX
Nix contains configurations that manage entire systems, and also small subsets of those systems. Where possible I reference the dotfiles inside `./dotfiles/` but this is not always an option. Otherwise I will use Nix `home-manager`.

### Minimal Shell
Quick shell to use with my aliases and configs. Nerd fonts not expected.

To activate on any nix-enabled system:
```sh

```
