# Dependency and Dotfile Management
Tired of not having what I need on EVERY device.

## INITIALIZE (any OS)
init (from fresh)
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ben-smyth/installs_bs/main/run.sh)"
```

## GNU STOW
A symlink farm manager. This enables me to keep all files inside this repository. I don't need to go through the hassle of copying and deleting files from this repository.

It is compatible with all services that I use - MacOS, Ubuntu, WSL.
